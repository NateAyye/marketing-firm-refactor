# Marketing Firm Refactor

This site needed a little bit of help with making the html more semantic by using better and more readable HTML Elements.

## What I Did

- IFirst noticed that the HTML was Mainly divs so I decided that the content containing the title and links should be the header and within the header I changed the container that
  had the list and made that into a <nav> element
- After that I saw that their were 3 main sections in the page and a final div which I made a <footer> so I looked and saw that the first of these had nothing in it just for holding the image.
  I made that a section to differentiate this from the rest of the page.
- Then the very next block that takes up most of the page I changed to the main block since it has all the content that the company wants the user to initially read/see.
- I also I made all the direct child elements of the main section an article element in order to destinguish the content change for each section.
